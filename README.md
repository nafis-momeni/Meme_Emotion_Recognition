# Meme Emotion Recognition Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Meme Emotion Recognition Project! This repository showcases an in-depth exploration of emotion recognition within memes, demonstrating proficiency in multiple machine learning models and multimodal learning techniques. Emotions in memes are complex, often embedded in humor, sarcasm, offense, and motivation, making this project a testament to expertise at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing.

## Data Source

To reproduce this project, you will need the Memotion dataset, which can be obtained from Kaggle. To facilitate the dataset download directly from Kaggle, you should set up Kaggle authentication using your `kaggle.json` file associated with your Kaggle account. Here's how:

- The Kaggle dataset page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/williamscott701/memotion-dataset-7k).
- Log in to your Kaggle account.
- Go to your Kaggle account settings [here](https://www.kaggle.com/account).
- Scroll down to the "API" section.
- Click "Create New API Token." This downloads a file called `kaggle.json`.
- Place the `kaggle.json` file in the content/ directory of the notebook.


## Models and Methods

This project exemplifies expertise in various machine learning models and multimodal learning methods. It explores multiple approaches, including but not limited to:

- **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM):** An RNN-based model for sequential data, although not achieving expected results, showcases proficiency with text-based models.
- **RoBERTa:** A transformer-based model demonstrating superior performance for text analysis.
- **ResNet:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) typically used for image recognition.
- **Multimodal Fusion Techniques:** The project explores methods like Early Fusion and Gated Multimodal Units (GMU) to effectively combine textual and visual information.

## Usage

This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of machine learning models and multimodal learning techniques for meme emotion recognition. Review the `Meme_Emotion_Recognition.ipynb` notebook to delve into the details of these models and methods. Customize and experiment with the code to apply these techniques to your own projects and enhance your machine learning skills.
